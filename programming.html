<h1>Chapter 5: Programming Algorithms & Software Testing</h1>
<h2> Phases of computer program development:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Phase 1: Understanding the problem</li>
    <li>Phase 2: Design an algorithm to solve the problem</li>
    <li>Phase 3: Write the program code in appropriate language based on the algorithm</li>
    <li>Phase 4: Enter the program</li>
    <li>Phase 5: Execute the programs</li>
    <li>Phase 6: Test the program, find errors and debug, then retest</li>
    <li>Phase 7: Document and evaluate the program</li>
</ul>

<h2>Programming structures:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Sequential structure: Top-down execution</li>
        <li>Decision structures: if/then/else</li>
        <li>Iterative (Looping):
            <ul>
                <li>while loop: conitnue looping as long something is true</li>
                <li>repeat/ until loop: conitnue looping until something is true</li>
                <li>for loop a given number of times</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Recursive structures:
            <ul>
                <li>Repeat a set of instructions as a subtask of itself</li>
                <li>Repetition continues until:
                    <ul>
                        <li>degenerative case, which is a termination condition, is met (degenerative case is also called "base case"</li>
